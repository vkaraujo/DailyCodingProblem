# ðŸ§  Daily Coding Problem Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to problems sent by the [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/) site, which sends me one coding problem every day. The primary goal of this repository is to document my journey through these problems and share my solutions, primarily written in Ruby.

## ðŸ§± Project Structure

Each problem is contained in its own folder inside the `problems/` directory. Each folder is named `problem_XXX`, where `XXX` is the problem number.

- `solutionXXX.rb`: The Ruby script containing the solution.
- `solutionXXX_spec.rb`: The RSpec test file for the solution.
- `Readme.md`: A markdown file describing the problem.

## âœ… Running Tests

Tests are written using RSpec. To run all tests:

```bash
bundle exec rspec
```
You can also run a specific test file:
```bash
bundle exec rspec problems/problem_001/solution001_spec.rb
```

## ðŸ›  Tooling & Extras

### Simple-Cov report

To run a coverage report:
```bash
COVERAGE=true bundle exec rspec
```
The image below is just an example and won't be updated in a regular manner

### Flog
[Flog gem repo](https://github.com/seattlerb/flog)
Flog reports the most tortured code in an easy to read pain report. The higher the score, the more pain the code is in.

If you download the project you can use
```bash
flog . # to run it for the whole project
# or
flog path/to/file.rb # to run it for a specific file
```

Due to the complexity of the challenges, lowering the flog score was not a priority.
I only installed it to experiment with it.
