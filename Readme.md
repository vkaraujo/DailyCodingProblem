# Daily Coding Problem Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to problems sent by the [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/) site, which sends me one coding problem every day. The primary goal of this repository is to document my journey through these problems and share my solutions, primarily written in Ruby.

## Project Structure

Each problem is contained in its own directory, named `problem_XXX` where `XXX` is the problem number. Inside each problem's directory, you will find:

- `solutionXXX.rb`: The Ruby script containing the solution.
- `solutionXXX_spec.rb`: The RSpec test file for the solution.
- `Readme.md`: A markdown file describing the problem and my approach to solving it.

## Running Tests

Tests are written using RSpec. To run the tests for a problem, navigate to the problem's directory and execute the following command:

```bash
cd problem_001
rspec solution001_spec.rb
```

## Contributing

While this project is primarily for my personal development, I'm open to contributions, suggestions, and discussions on different solutions to these problems. Feel free to open an issue or a pull request if you have any inputs or corrections.
